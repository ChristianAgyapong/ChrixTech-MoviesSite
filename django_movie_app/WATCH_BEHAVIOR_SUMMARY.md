# Watch History Behavior - User Manual

## ‚úÖ **Current Behavior (After Updates)**

### üéØ **No Automatic Watch History Addition**
- **Movies are NOT automatically added to watch history when viewed**
- Users must **manually click "Mark as Watched"** to add movies to their watch history
- This gives users full control over what they consider "watched"

### üé¨ **Movie Detail Page Experience**

#### **For Unwatched Movies:**
```html
[Mark as Watched] - Blue button, clickable
```
- Users see a blue "Mark as Watched" button with eye icon
- Clicking adds the movie to their watch history
- Button immediately changes to show "Already Watched" state

#### **For Already Watched Movies:**
```html
[Already Watched] - Green button, disabled
```
- Users see a green "Already Watched" button with check icon  
- Button is disabled to prevent duplicate entries
- Clear visual indication that they've already watched this movie

### üìã **Watch History Page**
- Shows all movies the user has manually marked as watched
- Each movie shows when it was watched
- "Re-watch" button allows users to update the watch timestamp

### üîÑ **Smart Button Updates**
- **Real-time UI updates**: Button changes immediately after marking as watched
- **Duplicate prevention**: Database constraints prevent duplicate watch entries
- **Visual feedback**: Loading states and success messages guide user interaction

## üõ°Ô∏è **Data Integrity Features**

### **Database Level Protection:**
```python
class UserWatchHistory(models.Model):
    class Meta:
        unique_together = ['user', 'movie']  # Prevents duplicates
```

### **Application Level Logic:**
```python
def add_or_update_watch_entry(cls, user, movie):
    """Smart method that either creates new entry or updates existing one"""
    # Prevents duplicate entries, updates timestamp if already exists
```

### **Frontend Validation:**
```javascript
// Request deduplication prevents rapid button clicking
// Cache system prevents duplicate API calls  
// Button disable logic provides immediate feedback
```

## üéÆ **User Journey Examples**
